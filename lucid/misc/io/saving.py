"""Method for saving arbitrary data to arbitrary destinations.

This module takes an object and URL, infers how to serialize and how to write
it out to the destination.

If an object could have multiple representations, this tries to infer the
intended representation from the URL's file extension.

Possible extension: if not given a URL this could create one and return it?
